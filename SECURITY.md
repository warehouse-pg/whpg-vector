# Security Release Process

WarehousePG Vector has adopted this security disclosure and response policy to
ensure we responsibly handle critical issues.

## Reporting a Vulnerability - Private Disclosure Process

Security is of the highest importance and all security vulnerabilities or
suspected security vulnerabilities should be reported to WarehousePG
privately, to minimize attacks against current users of WarehousePG
before they are fixed. Vulnerabilities will be investigated and patched on the
next patch (or minor) release as soon as possible. This information could be
kept entirely internal to the project.

If you know of a publicly disclosed security vulnerability for WarehousePG,
please **IMMEDIATELY** contact the WarehousePG project team
(security@warehousepg.org).

**IMPORTANT: Do not file public issues on GitHub for security vulnerabilities!**

To report a vulnerability or a security-related issue, please contact the email
address with the details of the vulnerability. The email will be fielded by the
WarehousePG project team. Emails will be addressed promptly, including a
detailed plan to investigate the issue and any potential workarounds to perform
in the meantime. Do not report non-security-impacting bugs through this
channel. Use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/warehouse-pg/whpg-vector/issues)
instead.

## Proposed Email Content

Provide a descriptive subject line and in the body of the email include the
following information:

- Basic identity information, such as your name and your affiliation or company.
- Detailed steps to reproduce the vulnerability (POC scripts, screenshots, and
  logs are all helpful to us).
- Description of the effects of the vulnerability on WarehousePG and the
  related hardware and software configurations, so that the WarehousePG
  project team can reproduce it.
- How the vulnerability affects WarehousePG usage and an estimation of
  the attack surface, if there is one.
- List other projects or dependencies that were used in conjunction with
  WarehousePG to produce the vulnerability.

## When to report a vulnerability

- When you think WarehousePG has a potential security vulnerability.
- When you suspect a potential vulnerability but you are unsure that it impacts
  WarehousePG.
- When you know of or suspect a potential vulnerability on another project that
  is used by WarehousePG.

## Patch, Release, and Disclosure

The WarehousePG project team will respond to vulnerability reports as
follows:

1. The WarehousePG project team will investigate the vulnerability and determine
   its effects and criticality.
2. If the issue is not deemed to be a vulnerability, the WarehousePG project team
   will follow up with a detailed reason for rejection.
3. The WarehousePG project team will initiate a conversation with the reporter
   promptly.
4. If a vulnerability is acknowledged and the timeline for a fix is determined,
   the WarehousePG project team will work on a plan to communicate with the
   appropriate community, including identifying mitigating steps that affected
   users can take to protect themselves until the fix is rolled out.
5. The WarehousePG project team will also create a
   [CVSS](https://www.first.org/cvss/specification-document) using the [CVSS
   Calculator](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0). The WarehousePG project
   team makes the final call on the calculated CVSS; it is better to move quickly
   than making the CVSS perfect. Issues may also be reported to
   [Mitre](https://cve.mitre.org/) using this [scoring
   calculator](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator). The CVE will
   initially be set to private.
6. The WarehousePG project team will work on fixing the vulnerability and perform
   internal testing before preparing to roll out the fix.
7. A public disclosure date is negotiated by the WarehousePG project
   team, and the bug submitter. We prefer to fully disclose the bug as soon as
   possible once a user mitigation or patch is available. It is reasonable to
   delay disclosure when the bug or the fix is not yet fully understood, or the
   solution is not well-tested. The timeframe for disclosure is from immediate
   (especially if it's already publicly known) to a few weeks. The WarehousePG
   project team holds the final say when setting a public disclosure date.
8. Once the fix is confirmed, the WarehousePG project team will patch the
   vulnerability in the next patch or minor release, and backport a patch release
   into earlier supported releases as necessary. Upon release of the patched
   version of WarehousePG, we will follow the **Public Disclosure Process**.

## Public Disclosure Process

The WarehousePG project team publishes a public advisory
to the WarehousePG community via GitHub.

## Mailing lists

- Use security@warehousepg.org to report security concerns to the WarehousePG
  project team, who uses the list to privately discuss security issues
  and fixes prior to disclosure.

## Confidentiality, integrity and availability

We consider vulnerabilities leading to the compromise of data confidentiality,
elevation of privilege, or integrity to be our highest priority concerns.
Availability, in particular in areas relating to DoS and resource exhaustion,
is also a serious security concern. The WarehousePG project team takes
all vulnerabilities, potential vulnerabilities, and suspected vulnerabilities
seriously and will investigate them in an urgent and expeditious manner.

Note that we do not currently consider the default settings for WarehousePG
to be secure-by-default. It is necessary for operators to explicitly
configure settings, role based access control, and other resource related
features in WarehousePG to provide a hardened WarehousePG environment. We will
not act on any security disclosure that relates to a lack of safe defaults.
Over time, we will work towards improved safe-by-default configuration, taking
into account backwards compatibility.
